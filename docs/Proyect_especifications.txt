🃏 Software Requirements Specification (SRS): Blackjack Game
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for the Blackjack system to be developed.
The system will allow users to play a standard Blackjack game against a computerized dealer, following the official game rules.

1.2 Scope

The system will be an application (either web-based or desktop) that allows users to:

Start and play Blackjack rounds.

Place virtual chip bets.

Perform standard Blackjack actions (“Hit,” “Stand,” “Double,” “Split”).

Display the outcome of each round and the user’s balance.

The system may later be expanded to include multiplayer functionality, user registration, and player statistics.

1.3 Definitions

Player: The user who plays the game.

Dealer: The computer-controlled opponent.

Hand: A set of cards dealt to the player or the dealer.

Bet: The amount of virtual chips the player wagers per round.

2. System Overview

The Blackjack system will provide an intuitive interface where the player competes against the dealer.
The main flow of the game will be:

The player places a bet.

The system deals two cards to the player and two to the dealer (one hidden).

The player performs actions (Hit, Stand, Double, Split).

The dealer automatically plays according to Blackjack rules.

The system determines the winner and updates the player’s balance.

3. Functional Requirements

FR3. Player Actions

FR3.1: The player can choose from the following actions:

Hit: Draw one additional card.

Stand: End the turn and keep the current total.

FR3.2: The system updates the game state based on the chosen action.

FR4. Dealer Turn

FR4.1: The dealer plays automatically following standard Blackjack rules (draw until reaching 17 or higher).

FR5. Result Calculation
